    Agri-environmental indicators (AEI) are indicators able to describe and assess state and trends in the environmental performance of agriculture to furnish useful indications to scientists and policymakers about the state of the environment, about the effects of different policies, as well as about the efficiency in the use of budgets in terms of environmental outcomes.
    <br><br>
    AEIs have ideally to be robust, timely, simple, and relevant to the different stakeholders involved in agriculture. The most used indicator framework subdivides AEIs according to five categories within the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model developed by the European Environment Agency (EEA 1999) and built upon the PSR model (OECD 1993).
    <br><br>
    The Agri-Environmental Indicators dataset available within FAOSTAT has been produced in line with the Agri-Environmental Indicators frameworks developed by OECD and EUROSTAT in the last 20 years. Each indicator is described by different data series.
