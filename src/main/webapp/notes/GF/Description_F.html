GHG emissions data from forest land are currently limited to emissions from net forest conversion to non-forest land. They consist of the balance of CO<sub style='font-size: 8px;'>2</sub> sources and sinks associated with deforestation and afforestation activities within a country. UNFCCC parties report these data in a more disaggregated fashion, under various LULUCF categories. They are computed following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Vol. 4, Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4; available by country, with global coverage and relative to the period 1990-2010, with annual updates.

The mapping between IPCC and FAOSTAT definition of forest land is reported below:

				Forest Land includes all land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in the national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall below, but in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land category.
			</td>
			<td>
				Forest area is the land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ (FRA). It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 metres in situ. Areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and a tree height of 5 m are included, as are temporarily unstocked areas, resulting from human intervention or natural causes, which are expected to regenerate.

				<i>Includes:</i> areas with bamboo and palms provided that height and canopy cover criteria are met; forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest; windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 metres; plantations primarily used for forestry or protective purposes, such as: rubber-wood plantations and cork, oak stands.
